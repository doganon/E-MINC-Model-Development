# Extended Multiple Interacting Continua (E-MINC) Model 
Purpose: This tools aims to improve Multiple Interacting Continua (MINC) parameters by taking equi-dimensional DFM (ED-DFM) model as a reference solution. The method is called Extended Multiple Interacting Continua (E-MINC).

The folders of the repository are as follows:
1)  Kmeans_Pressure_Contour_Determination:
  Jupyter notebook - phyton script uses kmeans algorithm to determine the pressure contours from a reference equi-dimensonal discrete fracture model pressure values so that pressure distribution within each nested blocks of E_MINC model is as homogeneous as possible with minimum variance.

2)  E-MINC_Model Development:
      Comsol doesn't have a E-MINC model. E-MINC model is developed under matlab script environement
